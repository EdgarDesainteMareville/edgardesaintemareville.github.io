I am a first year PhD student in the Inria [OCKHAM team](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/fr/) of the [LIP laboratory](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) at ENS Lyon, working under the supervision of [Elisa Riccietti](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/elisa.riccietti/), [Paulo Gonçalves](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/paulo.goncalves/) and [Nelly Pustelnik](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/nelly.pustelnik/).

I am interested in multilevel optimization and learning-based methods for inverse problems.
